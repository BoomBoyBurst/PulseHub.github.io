  <h2>About the Creator</h2>
  <p>
    Hey there! I’m <strong>A kid Who just made it in to high school</strong>, the creator of Pulse Hub.<br>
    I like making games and web development which inspired me to build this site, aiming to bring fun, Entertainment, and an easy way for anyone to access cool web games and share new game ideas.

    I love making projects that grow with the community. If you have a game idea or feedback, click <a href="request.html">Request a Game</a> in the menu!

    Thank you for visiting Pulse Hub. Have fun and stay tuned for new updates!
